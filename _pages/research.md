My research in my PhD with short description:

***Permeability calculation through membranes using molecular dynamics and diffusion models***

Permeation of small molecules through membrane is of fundamental importance for many biological processes. Here permeabilities are calculated and compared with two approaches based on Fick's first law and the inhomogenous solubility-diffusion model. We showed that the free energy and diffusion profiles for ethanol through POPC membrane lacks accuracy at higher permeant concentration due to non-Markovian kinetics caused by collective behavior. In contrast, counting method provides unbiased estimates. Finally, we showed that permeabilities obtained from single bilayer simulations can be combined to represent a natural gradient concentration felt by a cellular membrane which accurately models the non-equilibrium efffects of ethanol permeability from single bilayer simulations in equilibrium.
