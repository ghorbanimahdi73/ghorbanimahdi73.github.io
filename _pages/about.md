I am currently PostDoctoral Scholar at [Keiserlab](https://keiserlab.org) at UCSF. In Keiserlab I develop generative models to develop novel drug molecules based on protein pocket. I obtained my PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Maryland working with Prof. Klauda ([Klauda lab](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jbklauda/)). Since June 2019 I started to work at the National Institute of Health, NIH, with Prof. Brooks ([Brooks lab](https://www.lobos.nih.gov/cbs/)) as a pre-Doctral IRTA fellow.

Besides science I enjoy running. Here is a picture of me in my last marathon (Oct 2021).
